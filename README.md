# SeriesManager

SeriesManager is an application who help you to manage all the series you want to, you already or you're watching.
You can add, edit or delete a series in the list. 
You also can add categories or set an order to display some series and a dark mode is present.
There is also a search bar and you can hide all the series that are marks as finished.

## How it works ?

All the information that you enter in SeriesManager is saved in a data.json file to be downloaded at each end of your manager's update session.
If you already have a data.json file, you can load it by selecting it and then clicking "Load Data". 
(And don't forget to download it again at the end of your session.)

## One Page

There is a one page version of the app. 
This will allow you to launch the application without having to have a server (because of CORS security).

The one page is the file named "SeriesManager (One Page).html"

### Note

I know it's not perfect but it do the job and I don't need a better.
I just needed a way to save locally all the series that I watch so I did that.
